# Routes Folder

This folder contains the route configurations and navigation logic for the application. It defines how different parts of the app are connected and ensures smooth navigation between pages or components.

### Key Responsibilities:
- Define application routes.
- Manage navigation logic.
- Handle route-specific parameters and guards.

Keep this folder organized to maintain clarity and scalability of the application's routing structure.
