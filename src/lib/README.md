# lib Folder

The `lib` folder serves as a centralized location for shared utilities, API clients, custom hooks, and other reusable logic within the application. This structure promotes code reusability and maintainability across the project.

## Contents

### 1. API Clients
- Centralized modules for interacting with external APIs.
- Handles authentication, request/response formatting, and error handling.

### 2. Custom Hooks
- Reusable React hooks for managing state, side effects, and other logic.
- Examples include data fetching hooks, form handlers, and more.

### 3. Utilities
- Helper functions and shared logic used across the application.
- Examples include formatting utilities, validation functions, and constants.

## Usage
Import the necessary modules or hooks from the `lib` folder to ensure consistency and reduce duplication in your codebase.

```javascript
import useCustomHook from '../lib/hooks/useCustomHook';
import apiClient from '../lib/api/apiClient';
```

## Contribution
When adding new utilities or hooks, ensure they are well-documented and tested. Follow the project's coding standards to maintain consistency.
