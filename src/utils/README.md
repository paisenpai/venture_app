# Utils Folder

The `utils` folder contains helper files with utility functions that support the logic throughout the application. These utility functions are designed to be reusable and modular, providing common functionality that can be shared across different parts of the codebase.

## Purpose

- Simplify complex operations by abstracting repetitive logic.
- Improve code maintainability and readability.
- Promote reusability across the application.

## Contribution

When adding new utility functions:

1. Ensure the function is generic and reusable.
2. Write clear documentation and examples for its usage.
3. Add unit tests to verify its functionality.
