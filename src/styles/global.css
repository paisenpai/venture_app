/* 
    Tailwind Base Layer + Custom Styles

    This CSS file includes the base layer of Tailwind CSS, which provides 
    foundational styles such as resets and default typography. Additionally, 
    it contains custom styles that extend or override the default Tailwind 
    configuration to meet specific design requirements.

    - Tailwind Base Layer: Ensures consistent styling across browsers and 
        provides a clean slate for building components.
    - Custom Styles: Adds project-specific adjustments or enhancements 
        to complement the Tailwind framework.

    Use this file to define global styles or to customize the base layer 
    as needed for your project.
